# Installing Noir

There are two ways to install Noir; from source or from the compiled binary.

## Installing Noir from Source

- Download [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

- Now download Noir from Github using the following git command: `git clone git@github.com:noir-lang/noir.git`

- Now `cd` into the nargo directory and use `cargo install --locked --path=.` to compile the binary and store it in your path.

> The nargo directory should be located under `crates/nargo`
