# Comments

A comment is a line in your codebase which the compiler ignores, however it can be seen read by programmers.

Here is a single line comment:

```rust,noplaypen
// This is a comment and is ignored
```
`//` is used to tell the compiler to ignore the whole line.

A multi-line comment can be made by including `//` on each line

```rust,noplaypen
// This is a multi line
// comment, that is ignored by 
// the compiler
```
